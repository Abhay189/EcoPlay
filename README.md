# EcoPlay

## Inspiration
In this fast-paced world, children are not given enough exposure to sustainability practices as their parents/guardians are busier than ever. 
EcoPlay allows children to get educated about sustainable practices while enjoying the fun games!

## What it does
Eco-play offers an interactive adventure for kids, combining education and entertainment to teach them about recycling, water conservation, and biodiversity through exciting missions and games.
The app consists of multiple games that teach children about sustainability.

## How we built it
We built it using the Unity Game Engine and C#.

## Challenges we ran into
Time constraint was the biggest challenge that stopped us from implementing a more complete app with a variety of games.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud to learn a new technology in under 24 hours. We had a very steep learning curve but we were committed to implementing the idea the best we could. 

## What's next for EcoPlay
Due to the modular design of EcoPlay, we aim to add many more mini-games that mimic various sustainability practices. 
We can partner with various non-profit organizations to donate app revenue towards sustainable causes. Schools can introduce this app to their students to engage their students in learning about sustainable practices in a fun way.
